On an island cut off from the outside world, a self-sufficient energy supply network is to be expanded. 
The energy supply network consists of consumers (consumers) and producers (producers). 
Consumers and producers are connected via lines (PowerLine). 
The goal of the game is to provide consumers with the best possible energy. 
At the same time, the most sustainable forms of energy should be used and the least possible costs should be incurred. 
Therefore, substations (TransformerStation) can be upgraded to power plants and the capacity of existing power lines. 
These goals are each evaluated by a points system. Positive effects on the score have:

1. The cost-effective construction of power plants and expansion of power lines,

2. The clever regulation of power plants and consumers to avoid overproduction. 
		It is important to regulate as far as possible forward, since the regulation itself also causes costs and

3. to achieve the highest possible share of renewable energies. 
		Each unit of energy produced is weighted according to its share of renewable forms of energy in the overall scenario.
